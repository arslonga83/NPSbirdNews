# NPSbirdNews

Some basic API practice for Zero to Mastery course. It fetches the latest news from the National Park Service API, specifically searching for "bird". Then it pulls from the received data to create cards that are added to the dom. Includes title, summary, and links. Might be fun to add date to each post, and maybe possibility to let user specify a search other than birds? (but why?!)
